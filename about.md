Hi, I'm Mikael. I'm a mathematician, iOS engineer and rubyist living in New York City. I make native iOS apps and web services and write on [raywenderlich.com](http://www.raywenderlich.com/u/kmikael).

I spend a lot of time on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mkonutgan) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kmikael/).

If you're a [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) user, you might remember my app, Pinbrowser.

This site you're looking at right now was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

[Email me](mailto:me@kmikael.com) or [write me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mkonutgan) and say hi if you're feeling friendly.
