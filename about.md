Hi, I'm Mikael, I'm a student and developer living in Vienna. I make native iOS apps and code mostly in Ruby the rest of the time.

I spend a lot of time on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mkonutgan) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kmikael/).

If you're a [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) user, you might want to check out my app, <a href="http://www.pinbrowser.co" id="pinbrowser">Pinbrowser</a>.

This site you're looking at right now was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

[Email me](mailto:me@kmikael.com) and say hi.
