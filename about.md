Hi, I'm Mikael. I'm a mathematician, independent iOS developer and rubyist living in Vienna. I make native iOS apps and web services.

I spend a lot of time on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mkonutgan) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kmikael/). I'm also on [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/kmikael).

If you're a [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) user, you might want to check out my app, [Pinbrowser](http://www.pinbrowser.co).

This site you're looking at right now was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

[Email me](mailto:me@kmikael.com) or [write me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mkonutgan) and say hi if you're feeling friendly.
