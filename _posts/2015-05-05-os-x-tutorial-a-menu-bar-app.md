title: "OS X Tutorial: A Menu Bar App"
---

[My post about making Simple Menu Bar Apps for OS X]({% post_url 2013-07-01-simple-menu-bar-apps-for-os-x %}) has been one of the most viewed pages on my site since I wrote it back almost 2 years ago. It was never a complete tutorial to begin with, more of a few tips and tricks of how to do it well and a link to an example app I had written.

Since then, Apple has released Yosemite, which changes the way the menu bar APIs work and makes showing custom views in a popover in place of a simple menu much easier. Also, as you probbaly know, we have a [brand new language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) to write OS X apps with.

My tutorial was due an update, so I pitched the idea of writing a complete menu bar app for OS X tutorial to Ray, [for whom I have been updating tutorials for iOS 8 and Swift](http://www.raywenderlich.com/u/kmikael) and he liked it.

Check out the tutorial at [raywenderlich.com](http://www.raywenderlich.com/98178/os-x-tutorial-menus-popovers-menu-bar-apps). I show you how to build a complete menu bar app that shows inspiratinal quotes in a popover.
