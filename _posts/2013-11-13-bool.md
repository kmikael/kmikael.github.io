# BOOL

I recently bought the [NSHipster book](https://gumroad.com/l/nshipster) and was rereading [BOOL / bool / Boolean / NSCFBoolean](http://nshipster.com/bool/) and noticed the part where [Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) explains how comparing with `YES` can be dangerous, because `BOOL` is a `typedef` of `signed char`. I remembered that on 64-bit devices `BOOL` is actually a `typedef` of `bool`, the native (as of C99) boolean type.

The intersting thing is that the native `bool` type is safe, safe in the sence that a variable typed as `bool` can only ever have the values `0` or `1`. So

	BOOL value = 5;
    NSLog(@"%d", value);
    
prints `5` on all iPhone's except for the iPhone 5s, where it prints `1`.

Also e.g. `(BOOL)5` is `1` on 64-bit devices, getting rid of the awkward `!!` pattern to safely cast other types into booleans.

Even so, you probably shouldn't compare boolean expressions with `YES`, but at least you will get the expected result on 64-bit devices going forward, as functions or methods returning `BOOL` will always return `0` or `1`.
